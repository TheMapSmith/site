    <h2>You live and breathe maps.</h2>
    <p>
      You’re a geoprofessional who is forced to do uninspiring,
      unfulfilling, unproductive geo-grunt work. You manage your
      server, tend to your geodatabase, and make handouts for
      the executive staff meeting and simple maps for the
      sales slide deck.
    </p>

    <p>
      You read about people in your field doing interesting,
      fulfilling, fun work, and you wish you were like them.
      Why do they get the interesting projects and you only
      get to make 8.5x11 maps? GIS is useful for so much more
      than that. It can be used to empower decision makers,
      track field assets, analyze past project efficiency,
      and project future budgetary needs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything happens somewhere, and you want that place to
      be tracked in your database, not the engineer’s spreadsheet.
      You want to visualize, analyze, and design solutions for
      your company based on data, not politics or feelings.
      You have the tools at your fingers to do amazing things
      for your business, yet you’re relegated to newsletters
      and website graphics.
    </p>

    <p>
      How can you break out of that cycle? That’s what I’m here
      to teach you. In this free, 9-part email course, you’ll
      learn the tools, tricks, and techniques to apply your
      existing skills, and learn new skills like design thinking
      to your daily tasks and future projects.
    </p>

      The end result will be more interesting and fulfilling work.
