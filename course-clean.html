    <h2>You live and breathe maps.</h2>
    <p>
      It doesn't matter if you are a GIS intern or the Chief Cartographer.
      Whether you work in government, private industry, or the non-profit
      sector, this course contains lessons for everyone.</p>

    <p>
      Everything happens somewhere, and you want that place to be tracked in your
      database, not the engineer’s spreadsheet. You want to visualize, analyze, and
      design solutions for your company based on data, not politics or feelings. You
      have the tools at your fingers to do amazing things for your business, yet
      you’re relegated to newsletters and website graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re a geospatial professional stuck in a rut. You’ve become known as the map
      girl, the data guy, or the report wizard. You get asked about why the printer
      isn’t working more than you get asked about the new web mapping platform you
      spent months developing.

    <h3>Stephen Smith</h3>
    <p>
      I've been working in the geospatial field since 2008. I have wide-ranging
      industry experience, including CAD engineering, telecommunications, defense,
      civil infrastructure, emergency response, oil and gas, and transportation. I’m
      also a 2014 Esri Special Achievement in GIS (SAG) award winner, and my map was
      featured in Wired’s 2014 favorite maps of the year.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>
      You want to do fulfilling and fun work.  I want to give you the skills it takes
      to do the interesting projects, not get stuck making 8.5" x 11" maps. GIS is useful
      for so much more! It can be used to empower decision makers, track field assets,
      analyze past project efficiency, and project future budgetary needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can you break out of that cycle? That’s what I’m here to teach you. In this
      free, 9-part email course, you’ll learn the tools, tricks, and techniques to
      apply your skills to your daily tasks and future projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This course will save you time by including all the of the lessons I've learned
      along the way, and how they apply to the geospatial industries specifically.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The end result will be more interesting and fulfilling work. <br>
