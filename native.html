        <p>
          I created this as a gift for my map-loving cousin who is is part
          Native American and works in DC as an attorney for the National
          Indian Gaming Commission. I found out from his wife that
          he really liked the
          <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/maps/aian_wall_maps.html" target="_blank" id="aianmap">
            official maps</a> put out by the US Census, but wanted "something retro"
            with the same data.

          If you asked me to define what "retro" means I couldn't do it.
          It's one of those "you know it when you see it" things. Because of that,

        <h1>The Design</h1>
        <h2>Build from the ground up</h2>
        <p>
          Initially I wasn't sure how I was going to style the reservations, so I began
          by using the colors to build a subtle, retro background map. At the same time
          I wanted to utilize some of the cool cartographic features of
          <a href="http://qgis.com" target="_blank" id="qgis">QGIS</a> which
          I had never used for cartographic design before.
        </p>
        <h3>Borders</h3>
        <p>
          In searching the David Rumsey map collection for stylistic inspiration
          I kept running into an outlined border gradient style. I thought that would make
          a nice and unique style for the background so I set out to replicate it in QGIS.
        <img src="proj/native/borders.png" alt="state borders" class="img-responsive img-centered shadow"/>
        </p>
        <p class="center">

        </p>

          In QGIS this was fairly simple thanks to the lovely Shapeburst graphic style as shown.

          <strong>The 4-Color Theorem</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Using that style was easy enough, but I wanted there to be some variation between
          state borders. For that, I turned to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem"
          target="_blank" id="4color">Four Color Theorem.</a>
        </p>

        <p class="center">

        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org" target="_blank" id="qgisplugins">
            exhaustive plugins library</a>, it's easy to extend QGIS' functionality.
            For help automatically processing the four-color theorem I turned to <thead>
              <a href="https://github.com/nyalldawson/topocolour" target="_blank" id="topocolour">
              topocolour plugin.</a> Strangely, QGIS threw a script error,
              but it worked nonetheless! Now I had one of 5 unique color values for
              each state border.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Blending Modes</strong></p>
        <p>
          For the borders I wanted colors that were complimentary to the existing
          color scheme, but I knew that the bold colors I chose above would look
          best as the reservations areas. To save myself the trouble of coming up
          with five more colors in the same theme, I used another one of QGIS'
          awesome tools - blending modes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blending modes is a special rendering type where pixels in one layer are
          mixed together through the settings <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.8/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/vector_properties.html#layer-rendering"
          target="_blank" id="blending">described here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="proj/native/blending.gif" alt="blending modes gif" class="img-responsive img-centered shadow" />
        </p>
        <p>
          I used the blending mode <strong>Soft Light</strong>, which combines the
          <em>Burn</em> - causing the underlying pixels to darken, and <em>Dodge</em>
          - brightening and saturating the underlying pixels. The great part of this
          in the end is that for the state outlines I pick a set of typical colors...
        </p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-2 colors" style="background-color:red;"></div>
          <div class="col-xs-2 colors" style="background-color:green;"></div>
          <div class="col-xs-2 colors" style="background-color:blue;"></div>
          <div class="col-xs-2 colors" style="background-color:purple;"></div>
          <div class="col-xs-2 colors" style="background-color:orange;"></div>
        </div>
        <p>
          ...and end up with a beautiful, subtle, retro color scheme.

        </p>
        <h3>The Fonts</h3>
        <p>
          Another major component of a maps style is the font choice. I wanted
          to give this map a distinctive look, but I wasn't sure which fonts were
          retro and which were modern. I turned to trusty Google.
        </p>
        <aside class="devgoogle shadow">
          <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=retro+fonts" target="_blank" id="#DG">
          <button type="button" name="button" class="dg">#devgoogle</button></a>
          <code>retro fonts</code>
        </aside>
        <p>
          The restuls were a lot of script fonts, and lots of "distressed" fonts with
          faux degredation. I was looking for a "crisper" design, so I overlooked those
          results.
        </p>
        <img src="proj/native/retrofonts.png" alt="retro fonts" class='img-responsive img-centered shadow' />
        <p class="center">
          <i>Lots of nice looking fonts.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first typeface that caught my eye was
           was <a href="http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=muncie" id="muncie" target="_blank">Muncie.</a>
          However it ended up being a difficult font to work into the design. I briefly tried similar fonts
          like <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic" id='league' target="_blank">League Gothic</a>
          but felt that as a label the tall, narrow design wasn't as readable. From there I turned to Google Fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Google Fonts</strong> <br>
          My favorite source to turn to for fonts is the ever-growing Google Fonts library.
          They provide an insane variety of free fonts that you can easily use in websites
          or designs. I scrolled through the list looking for fonts that were similar to
          the ones in the Google search above. In the end I settled on the following typefaces:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat" id="Montserrat" target="_blank">Montserrat</a></strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>"The old posters and signs in the traditional neighborhood of Buenos Aires called Montserrat inspired me to design a typeface that rescues the beauty of urban typography from the first half of the twentieth century.""</i></li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather" id="merriweather" target="_blank">Merriweather</a></strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>"Merriweather was designed to be a text face that is pleasant to read on screens.""</i></li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Quicksand">Quicksand</a></strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li><i>A geometric sans-serif display font.</i></li>

          <h1>The challenge</h1>
          <h2>Stylistic reservations</h2>
          <p>
            After completing the background styles it was time to symbolize and label
            the reservations themselves. Cartographically, this was actually surprisingly difficult.
            Here are the issues I ran into.

          </ol>
          <p>

            <img src="proj/native/cluster.png" alt="SoCal reservation cluster" class="img-responsive img-centered shadow" />
            I can tell you from looking that those labels were <i>hand-placed.</i>
          </p>
          <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>Had both long and short names</strong></li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Oklahoma had the <strong>Kiowa-Comanche-Apache-Ft Sill-Apache/Caddo-Wichita-Delaware</strong>,
            (that's the <i>full</i> name!) to the <strong>Zia</strong> in Arizona. This meant that labeling
            had to be flexible and contain enough rules so that both long name and short name
            reservations showed up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the Navajo map again, we see a few other difficulties:
            <ul>
              <li>The features are <i>multi-part</i>, meaning that one element on the map
                has multiple pieces. This makes labeling the reservations more difficult because
                you have to craft label placement rules that prevent repeated labels.
              </li>
              <li>There are <i>overlapping</i> reservations. The purple cutout from the
                Navajo reservation is a Hopi reservation. This will also present labeling
                difficulties as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                Looking closer at the data, nearly every tribe has both a <i>reservation</i>
                <strong>and</strong> an <i>off-reservation land trust</i>. This is yet another
                challenge for labeling.
              </li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Artistic Decisions</h1>
        <h2>Style <i>and</i> Substance?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>The Style</strong><br>
          After some experimenting, I decided to try to give the reservations and pseudo-3D appearance
          using QGIS' brilliant styling options. I started with a darker shape offset 1px on
          both the X and Y axis. Then I added an extra-thick border so that all the
          very small reservations would show up. Then I capped it off with the color
          picked from the inspirational map above.
        </p>
        <img src="proj/native/reservation.png" alt="reservation style" class='img-responsive img-centered shadow' />
        <p>
          <strong>The Labels</strong><br>
          The labels presented a serious conundrum. As a geographer I wanted to be sure
          that every element on the map received equal representation. As an American I
          didn't want to inadvertently disrespect any native tribes. As a layperson on Native affairs I didn't
          want the map's recipient to call out any errors on the map. As an entrepreneur
          I couldn't afford to spend the hours and hours it would take to get every label placed perfectly.
          But as a cartographer I wanted my map to do it's job - show Native American
          reservations in a cool artistic way.<br>
          <strong>What to do?</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Map as Art</h3>
        <p>
          In the end, I decided that my first principle would be <em>legibility.</em> Since this
          would be a 24"x36" framed canvas, I wanted the reservation names to be visible from 5'-6' away.
          That meant a large display font. I went with 15pt Montserrat with a 1.5mm halo and a 1.5mm shadow.
          This created enough visual hierarchy to separate the label from the background and
          make it legible enough at long distances.
        </p>
        <img src="proj/native/reservation-labels.png" alt="reservation style" class='img-responsive img-centered shadow' />
        <p>
          With legibility as a guide I setup the rest of the labeling rules so that as many
          labels as possible were placed without sacrificing readability. I spent a
          good deal of time trying to get this right. In the end I was fairly satisfied
          with the tradeoff between accuracy and style.
